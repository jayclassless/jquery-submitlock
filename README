jQuery SubmitLock Plugin v1
https://bitbucket.org/twigtek/jquery-plugins


This plugin will lock form buttons when a form is submitted in an attempt
to prevent users from accidently double-posting forms.


Usage:
    $('#some_form').submitLock({ classes: 'locked_button' });


Options:
    includeButtons
        This is a boolean that tells the plugin to also lock <button/> and
        <input type="button" /> buttons in addition to <input type="submit" />
        buttons. Defaults to true.

    classes
        This is a string of class names to assign to the buttons when they
        are locked. Defaults to "submitLockDisabled".

    disable
        This is a boolean that tells the plugin whether or not to set the
        "disabled" attribute on the buttons to "true". Defaults to false.
