https://github.com/twigtek/jquery-submitlock


This plugin will lock the buttons on a form when it is submitted in an attempt
to prevent users from accidently double-submitting forms.

Requires jQuery v1.7+


Usage:
    $('#some_form').submitLock({ classes: 'locked_button' });


Options:
    includeButtons
        This is a boolean that tells the plugin to also lock <button> and
        <input type="button"> elements in addition to the usual
        <input type="submit"> and <input type="image"> elements. Defaults
        to true.

    includeResets
        This is a boolean that tells the plugin to also lock <input type="reset">
        elements in addition to the usual <input type="submit"> and
        <input type="image"> elements. Defaults to true.

    classes
        This is a string of class names to assign to the elemnts when they
        are locked. Defaults to "submitLockDisabled".

    disable
        This is a boolean that tells the plugin whether or not to set the
        "disabled" attribute on the elements to "true". Defaults to false.


Events:
    locked
        This event fires on the form after the plugin has completed its
        locking activities.
